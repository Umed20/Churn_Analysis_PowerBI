## Project Workflow

### Data Analysis and Transformation
- The churn data was ingested into Microsoft SQL Server.
- Performed various transformations and analysis to clean and prepare the data.
- Key metrics and dimensions were identified, including demographics, geography, payment methods, and services.

### Power BI Dashboard
- Created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for visualizing churn data.
- Visualizations include insights based on demographics, geography, payment methods, and services.
- The dashboard provides actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

### Machine Learning Model
- Used the prepared data to build a machine learning model.
- Implemented a Random Forest algorithm to predict which customers are likely to churn among new joiners.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
